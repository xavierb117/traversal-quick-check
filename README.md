# READ DIRECTIONS BEFORE STARTING!!!
# DO NOT USE OUTSIDE RESOURCES

The repository is meant to be a quick self-assessment to help you gauge your progress.

You are to attempt this assignment **WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE RESOURCES**. No notes, no reviewing old code, no web searches, no AI. Once you have cloned and opened the code in VS Code, start a time for *15 minutes*. Try your best to complete the exercise(s) within the time.

If you are not finished after 15 minutes, that is OK! But it is a signal that you should do some extra practice/review. I *strongly* reccommend coming by office hours or tutoring for review. Make a note of what parts were difficult or what you got stuck on and bring those notes for a review session.
